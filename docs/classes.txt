I have a few ideas on how to go about this, but my previous/default presumption
was to have 3-5 core attributes, then classes associated with each attribute and
combination of attributes. Separately I've also been thinking about reducing all
the equipment systems down to just weapons. If I did that, I'm kind of wondering
what it would look like (a lot of work) to associate classes with weapons. 

Attributes are probably
  strength
  dexterity
  intelligence
  faith
  ???

Weapon types...
  sword, dagger, bow, hammer/mace, handgun*, spear, fist weapons, shield?,
  greatsword?, focus/summoning stone/somesuch?, staff, wand, 
  * - or revolver or something, I just don't mean a long gun

For example:
  paladins could be the "str + faith, hammer"
  trapper could be "dex + int bow" 


I don't think it would be entirely possible to fill the diagram of every
variation (certainly not at first), so either we'd start with a subset or reduce
the number of weapons until the system fit. Also, there would likely be some
special classes I'd want to add that would only make sense for one weapon/stat
set (event classes or something similar). 

The other issue becomes differentiating weapon stat/modifier pools while still
making them big enough to be fun
